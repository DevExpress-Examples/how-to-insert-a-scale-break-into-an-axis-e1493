# How to insert a scale break into an axis

This example demonstrates how both automatic and manual [scale breaks](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/6232/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/axes/scale-breaks?p=netframework) can be created within an [axis](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5779/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram/axes?p=netframework), and customized at runtime.

Note that both auto-created and manual scale breaks on an axis can co-exist, without affecting the chart's output, in cases where their ranges interfere.
